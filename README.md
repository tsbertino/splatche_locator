# splatche_locator

This is the current repository where I am working on putting together my scripts and pipeline for integrating geospatial simulations from [SPLATCHE](http://www.splatche.com/splatche3) with the software [locator](https://github.com/kr-colab/locator), deep learning software that predicts geographic location from variants.
